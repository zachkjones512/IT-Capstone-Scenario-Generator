## About 

The **Cybersecurity Scenario Generator** is a web-application that uses a flask backend to serve a personalized powerpoint and CTF-style cybersecurity challenge based on a mad-libs-esque questionnaire the user fills out before receiving the file.

## Execution

On Windows machines, use the included run.bat file to begin the web-server and open the web-application. 
Prior to other machines receiving official support, they can run the program by using python to start the webserver using the following steps
- Ensure python is installed
- Install dependencies using "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- In a terminal of your choice, navigate to the project directory and run "python main.py"
- Finally, open a web browser to "127.0.0.1:5500" to begin the web-app.
